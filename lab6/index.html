<UL>
<LI> You are given an undirected graph with <i>n</i> nodes, numbered 0 through <i>n-1</i>.
<LI> Each node is assigned a color, which is a number from 0 through 9.  These colors are
given in a vector <b>color</b>.
<LI> Edges in the graph are specified by two vectors <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, where the edges
connect nodes <b>a[i]</b> and <b>b[i]</b>.
<LI> There are at most 2500 edges in the graph.
<LI> No more than 10 nodes may have the same color.
<LI> A <i>walk</i> in the graph is a path that visits every node in the graph exactly 
     once, and may be partitioned into subpaths, where the nodes in each subpath all have the 
     same color.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This is a wonderful problem -- a mixture of DFS and dynamic programming.  You have to program
it carefully, or you won't get it in under the time limit!
<p>
Obviously, you are going to focus on the connected components, which are denoted by the
node colors.  Once a path reaches a node of one color, it must travel through every node in 
that color's connected component, before it can go to a node with another color.
The constraints help you: There is a maximum of ten components, and each component has a
maximum of ten nodes.
<hr>
<h3>An Example</h3>
<p>
I put this into <b>main.cpp</b> as example 7:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Ex-7.jpg></td></table></center><p>

<pre>
color = { 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 }
a =     { 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4, 7, 7, 10, 10, 8, 2, 6 }
b =     { 1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9,  8,  9, 9, 3, 7 }
</pre>

I've colored the inter-component edges black, and the intra-component edges the same color
as the component nodes.
<p>
Let's logic our way through the answer.  It should be clear that the only paths are going
to go through the green-red-blue components in that order, or blue-red-green.  Let's focus
on the paths through the components, when they are going through green-red-blue.

<UL> 
<LI> There are two ways through the green component: 0-1-2 and 1-0-2.
<LI> There are two ways through the red component: 3-4-5-6 and 3-5-4-6.
<LI> There are four ways through the blue component: 7-8-9-10, 7-8-10-9, 7-9-8-10 and 7-9-10-8.
</UL>

That means that there are 2*2*4 = 16 paths that go through green-red-blue.
If you think about it, the paths that go through blue-red-green are the exact same paths
as green-red-blue, just in reverse.  So the answer is 32 paths.

<hr>
<h3> The solution, part 1</h3>

I solved this in two parts.  In the first part, I created a two-dimensional array <b>NP</b>.
<b>NP[i][j]</b> is non-zero only if nodes <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> are in the same connected
component.   It contains the number of paths from node <i>i</i> to node <i>j</i>, where each
path must contain every node in the component. 
<p>
In our example above, we'll have the following:

<UL>
<LI> <b>NP[0][1]</b> = <b>NP[0][2]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[1][0]</b> = <b>NP[1][2]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[2][0]</b> = <b>NP[2][1]</b> = 1.
<p>
<LI> <b>NP[3][4]</b> = <b>NP[3][5]</b> = <b>NP[4][3]</b> = <b>NP[5][3]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[6][4]</b> = <b>NP[6][5]</b> = <b>NP[4][6]</b> = <b>NP[5][6]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[3][6]</b> = <b>NP[6][3]</b> = 2.
<p>
<LI> <b>NP[7][8]</b> = <b>NP[7][9]</b> = <b>NP[8][7]</b> = <b>NP[9][7]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[10][8]</b> = <b>NP[10][9]</b> = <b>NP[8][10]</b> = <b>NP[9][10]</b> = 1.
<LI> <b>NP[7][10]</b> = <b>NP[10][7]</b> = 2.
</UL>

For a given node <i>i</i>, you can calculate <b>NP[i][j]</b> for all <i>j</i> using a 
an enhanced DFS which travels every intracomponent path from node <i>i</i>.  
While you're traveling each path, you keep track of the path length, and if you reach
a node <i>j</i> and the path length contains every node in the component, you increment 
<b>NP[i][j]</b>.
<p>
Let me run through an example, where the starting node is node 3.  When I did this,
I had a <b>V</b> (visited) field for each node, and a variable <b>NIP</b> (nodes in the path).
I set them all to zero.  Here is what happens when I call <b>DFS(3)</b>.  I call
it an "enhanced" DFS, because when you're done with a node, you set <b>V</b> back to 
zero, so it can participate in more paths.

<pre>
DFS(3):        NIP:0 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[3] to 1.
DFS(3):        NIP:1 -- Will call DFS on: 4 5
DFS(3):        NIP:1 -- Calling DFS(4)
  DFS(4):      NIP:1 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[4] to 1.
  DFS(4):      NIP:2 -- Will call DFS on: 6 5
  DFS(4):      NIP:2 -- Calling DFS(6)
    DFS(6):    NIP:2 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[6] to 1.
    DFS(6):    NIP:3 -- Will call DFS on: 5
    DFS(6):    NIP:3 -- Calling DFS(5)
      DFS(5):  NIP:3 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[5] to 1.
      DFS(5):  NIP:4 -- Setting NP[3][5] to 1.
      DFS(5):  NIP:3 -- Done.  Setting V[5] = 0
    DFS(6):    NIP:2 -- Done.  Setting V[6] = 0
  DFS(4):      NIP:2 -- Calling DFS(5)
    DFS(5):    NIP:2 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[5] to 1.
    DFS(5):    NIP:3 -- Will call DFS on: 6
    DFS(5):    NIP:3 -- Calling DFS(6)
      DFS(6):  NIP:3 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[6] to 1.
      DFS(6):  NIP:4 -- Setting NP[3][6] to 1.
      DFS(6):  NIP:3 -- Done.  Setting V[6] = 0
    DFS(5):    NIP:2 -- Done.  Setting V[5] = 0
  DFS(4):      NIP:1 -- Done.  Setting V[4] = 0
DFS(3):        NIP:1 -- Calling DFS(5)
  DFS(5):      NIP:1 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[5] to 1.
  DFS(5):      NIP:2 -- Will call DFS on: 6 4
  DFS(5):      NIP:2 -- Calling DFS(6)
    DFS(6):    NIP:2 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[6] to 1.
    DFS(6):    NIP:3 -- Will call DFS on: 4
    DFS(6):    NIP:3 -- Calling DFS(4)
      DFS(4):  NIP:3 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[4] to 1.
      DFS(4):  NIP:4 -- Setting NP[3][4] to 1.
      DFS(4):  NIP:3 -- Done.  Setting V[4] = 0
    DFS(6):    NIP:2 -- Done.  Setting V[6] = 0
  DFS(5):      NIP:2 -- Calling DFS(4)
    DFS(4):    NIP:2 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[4] to 1.
    DFS(4):    NIP:3 -- Will call DFS on: 6
    DFS(4):    NIP:3 -- Calling DFS(6)
      DFS(6):  NIP:3 -- Begin.  Increment NIP and Set V[6] to 1.
      DFS(6):  NIP:4 -- Setting NP[3][6] to 2.
      DFS(6):  NIP:3 -- Done.  Setting V[6] = 0
    DFS(4):    NIP:2 -- Done.  Setting V[4] = 0
  DFS(5):      NIP:1 -- Done.  Setting V[5] = 0
DFS(3):        NIP:0 -- Done.  Setting V[3] = 0
</pre>

This is most definitely an expensive algorithm.  Think about it -- if there are ten
nodes in a component, and the nodes are completely connected, then <b>NP[i][j]</b> 
will equal 8! for each <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.  That is because there is a path for
every permutation of the other nodes.  Of course, 8! equals 40,320, which is definitely
doable in the universe of topcoder.  
<hr>
<h3> The solution, part 2.</h3>

The second part uses dynamic programming.  Define the following procedure:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
long long NumWalks(int starting_node, int remaining_components);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This is going to return the number of legal paths that start with 
<b>starting_node</b>, go through <b>starting_node</b>'s component, and 
then go through <b>remaining_components</b>.  
<b>remaining_components</b> is an integer that stores a set of components
using bit arithmetic.  It should not include <b>starting_node</b>'s component.
You are going to sum up <b>NumWalks(n, s)</b> for every node
<b>n</b>, and every set <b>s</b> composed of all of the components except for
<b>n</b>'s component.
<p>

To implement <b>NumWalks(n, s)</b>, what you do is look at every 
node <b>m</b> in node <b>n</b>'s component.  If <b>NP[n][m]</b> 
is greater than zero, then you look at every node <b>l</b> which is
connected to <b>m</b> and in a component in <b>s</b>.  You then
call <b>NumWalks(l, s - l's component)</b>.  You will add the product of
that and <b>NP[n][m]</b>  to the return value for <b>NumWalks(n, s)</b>.

<p>
You need a base case for this -- if <b>s</b> = {}, then 
<b>NumWalks(n, s)</b> is the sum of all <b>NP[n][m]</b>.
<p>

Let's do an example -- we'll calculate <b>NumWalks(0, { red, blue } )</b>.
There are only two values of <b>NP[0][j]</b> which is greater than zero -- <b>NP[0][1]</b>
and <b>NP[0][2]</b> both equal one.  First, consider <b>NP[0][1]</b>.  There is 
no edge from 1 to the red or blue components.  So, there are no paths involving <b>NP[0][1]</b>.
<p>
Next, consider <b>NP[0][2]</b>.  There is an edge from 2 to 3, so the return value for
<b>NumWalks(0, { red, blue } )</b> is going to equal 
<b>NP[0][2]</b> (which is one) times
<b>NumWalks(3, { blue } )</b>.  So let's focus on 
<b>NumWalks(3, { blue } )</b>:
<p>
Although <b>NP[3][4]</b> and <b>NP[3][5]</b> equal one, neither four nor five are connected
to the blue component.  So, the only value of <b>NP</b> that matters is <b>NP[3][6]</b>, 
which equals 2.   
<b>NumWalks(3, { blue } )</b> is going to equal 
<b>NP[3][6]</b> times
<b>NumWalks(7, { } )</b>.
<p>
So, we focus on on <b>NumWalks(7, { } )</b>.  This is the base case of the recursion -- it 
equals the sum of all <b>NP[7][m]</b>.  This is 4.  So
<b>NumWalks(3, { blue } )</b> equals 4*2 = 8.  And 
<b>NumWalks(0, { red, blue } )</b> equals 8*1 = 8.
<p>
This is dynamic programming, so you cache the return values of <b>NumWalks()</b>.  
The nodes are numbers from 0 to 9, and the component sets are numbers from 0 to 1023.  
So, your cache isn't that big -- best to make it a two-dimensional vector.
<p>
Below is the dynamic programming cache for example 7.  Go ahead and walk through it.

};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You should have <b>RG.cpp</b> include "RB.h", and then 
implement <b>countWays()</b> as I have described above.  Besides <b>countWays()</b>
and <b>Verbose</b>, you don't have to implement or use any of the member variables or methods
in this class.  They are the ones that I used, though, and they are all that you need.
You are not allowed to add things to this class.
<p>
Besides implementing <b>countWays()</b> so that it works correctly, you should
also implement the following inside <b>countWays()</b>:

<UL>
<LI> If the <b>Verbose</b> string contains the character 'N', then you should print out
all non-zero values of <b>NP</b>, one per line, in the form:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
NP[i][j] = value
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<LI> If the <b>Verbose</b> string contains the character 'C', then you should print out
your dynamic programming cache, one entry per line, in the form:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Cache[node][setid] = value
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>setid</b> should be in hex, preceded by "0x".  
</UL>

You can implement other functionality
for debugging, but I'll only test you on those two, and that you return the proper answer.
My code prints out the DFS if the verbose string contains 'D'.  You don't have to do that
(and you may not want to, because it may slow your code down too much).
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Testing with RG-Tester.cpp, and with Grade-Timer.sh</h3>

The makefile will make two executables:

<UL>
<LI> <b>RG-Tester</b>.  This uses the <b>main()</b> defined in <b>RG-Tester.cpp</b>.
You give it the verbose string as its first argument (or none) and <b>color</b>, <b>a</b>
and <b>b</b> on standard input.  These should be in the form "{ v0, v1, v2 }", where the
braces and the values should be distinct words.  The commas are optional -- I simply 
call <b>sscanf()</b> on the word to convert it to an integer.
<p>
<LI> <b>a.out</b>.  This makes <b>RainbowGraph.cpp</b> out of <b>RG.h</b> and <b>RG.cpp</b>
(concatenating them, and then deleting the line that includes <b>RB.h</b>), and compiles
it with <b>main.cpp</b>, so you can test how it does with the topcoder examples.  
Examples 1-7 are in 
<b>main.cpp</b>, along with Example 11 from the Topcoder system test which is a challenging
one time-wise.
</UL>

For grading, we're only going to use your <b>RG-Tester</b>.    
The gradescript tests the 'A' 'N' and 'C' verbose flags of <b>RG-Tester</b>.
Additionally, there is a shell script in the lab directory called
<b>Grade-Timer.sh</b>.  It times all of the gradescript examples whose numbers are 
one, mod three.  Your <b>RG-Tester</b> needs to complete each example in under 2 seconds
(mine works in under .75 seconds for each).  Don't try this on a heavily loaded machine.

<p>
I have examples 1-7 and example 11 as files in the lab directory (example 11 is

<h3>Four bullets of advice</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Be forewarned that the makefile will clobber <b>RainbowGraph.cpp</b>.  It will
copy it to <b>RainbowGraph.cpp.backup</b> first, but be ready for it.
<p>
<LI> The constraints pushed my program to the limits -- my first solution used a map for
the Dynamic Programming cache, and that was too slow.
<p>
<LI> My second was also too slow, because my DFS was too slow.  I fixed that by testing to
see if <b>V[i]</b> was one before calling <b>CountPaths(i)</b>.  Previously, I simply
put "if (V[i] == 1) return" as the first line of <b>CountPaths(i)</b>, and all of the
extra recursive calls made my program too slow.
<p>
<LI> As a corollary, if you have printing code in your DFS to help you debug, you need to
     comment it out before you do the topcoder test (as opposed to doing something like
     "if (Verbose.find('D') != string::npos) ...".
