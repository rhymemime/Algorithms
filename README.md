# Algorithms

This Repo contains a collection of scripts, C code, and (C like) C++ code written for an advanced algorithms class (whose name is withheld to make it slightly harder to search for). The code is all there, but I haven't checked the ability to compile and run since combing through and getting rid of unnecessary scripts and example inputs. Note that these were written with deadlines while other projects and responsibilities might have often been a priority, as is graduate school life. The comments and structure aren't necessarily as I would like them ideally, and the documentation exists better on the professor's website, so feel free to message me if you have questions.

I believe the repo clearly demonstrates an ability to deal with complex data structures and algorithms, while dealing with low level memory management. Particularly lab2-btree, shows my ability to implement an especially complex data structure directly on disk.
